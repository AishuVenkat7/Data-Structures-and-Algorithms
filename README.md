### Basics
* Data Structures are storage units used to store and organize data - done in a way so that data can be accessed and updated efficiently
* Types of data structures - Linear and Non-Linear
* Linear Data Structures - 
    - Elements are arranged in sequential order 
    - Easier to implement for less complex use cases
    - Arrays: Elements are arranged in continuous memory - all the elements that can be stored in an array are of the same type.
    - Stacks: Elements stored in LIFO (Last In First Out)
    - Queues: Elements stores in FIFO (First In First Out)
    - Linked List: Elements connected through a series of nodes, where each node contains item and address to the next node

* Non-Linear Data Structures - 
    - Non-sequential 
    - Arranged in hierarchical order - one element connected to one or multiple elements
    - Graphs: Each node is called a vertex and vertices are connected to each other via edges.
    - Trees: Similar to graphs, but there can only be one edge between two vertices.

| Linear Data Structures | Non-Linear Data Structures |
| :--------------------: | :-------------------------:| 
| Sequential             | Non-Sequential             | 
| All items present in single layer | In multiple layers | 
| Traversed in a single run | Requires multiple runs | 
| Inefficient memory utilization | Relatively efficient memory utilization |
| Time complexity increases with data | Time complexity remains the same |
